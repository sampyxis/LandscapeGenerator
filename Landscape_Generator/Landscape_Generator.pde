/* Landscape generator - first try
  My goal: build a tool that will generate 2D landscapes - 
    I want these to be painterly - not cold, but possibly to look like some old masters
    I'll need to keep tweaking.  I also want to be able to add colors, lines, and shapes as it's working.
    
    What is a landscape:
    
    Horizon line: random start between height - 1/3 height (top) and height - 2/3rds height (bottom)
      From left to right - not always so straight - maybe some perlin noise or fractols to draw the line.
    
    Sky: colors from sunny to dusk - source of light (sun or moon) randomly placed
    
    Ground:
